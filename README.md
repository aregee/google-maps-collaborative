==============================

An amusing meteorjs demo app that shows some of the awesomeness of meteorjs and lets you dabble around with 
something creative and highlighting core features of meteorjs.
It's not meant to be an exhaustive realtime Maps Application, but rather a simple hack of Google maps.

Whereever user clicks on the map, it creates a marker Small blue circle with overlaying larger red circle over the clicked area.On the other hand , parallel instance of the app shows the red circle over the marked area.
